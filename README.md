# Sales Forecasting for Alloy Products Using SQL & Power BI

##  What This Project Is About
This project helps predict future sales for a company selling alloy-based products online — think of it like an Amazon for industrial metals. It’s built to help business managers plan inventory, pricing, and category performance.

##  What I Did
- Cleaned and transformed raw sales data using complex SQL queries (joins, CTEs, window functions).
- Created a full Power BI dashboard showing trends, seasonality, and product category performance.
- Explored demand spikes and drops by alloy type, month, and region to help decision-makers take action.

##  Skills & Tools Used
SQL · Power BI · DAX · Python (for optional forecasting) · Excel
